    :synopsis: Geographic Information System (GIS) extensions for Django

GeoDjango is an included contrib module for Django that turns it into a
world-class geographic Web framework. GeoDjango strives to make it as simple
as possible to create geographic Web applications, like location-based services.
Its features include:

* Django model fields for `OGC`_ geometries
* Extensions to Django's ORM for querying and manipulating spatial data.
* Loosely-coupled, high-level Python interfaces for GIS geometry operations and
  data formats
* Editing geometry fields from the admin

.. _OGC: http://www.opengeospatial.org/
