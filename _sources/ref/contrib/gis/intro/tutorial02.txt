Working with GeoDjango, part 2: the admin site
==============================================

In the previous part of the tutorial, we learned how to create geo models. One
of Django's strengths is its built-in admin interface, and GeoDjango supports
easy edition of your geometry fields right in this very admin.

Positions such as ``(10, 10)`` or ``(10, 12)`` are not really human-friendly:
we can't easily tell where such a position will be located on a map. Also if
you deal with fields such as
:class:`~django.contrib.gis.db.models.PolygonField`, you'll definitely want a
nice interface to draw your polygon. The
:class:`~django.contrib.gis.admin.GeoModelAdmin` class makes this easier by
displaying a map as a widget for geometric fields.  Edit the
``tracking/admin.py`` file so it looks like this::

    from django.contrib.gis import admin
    from .models import Animal, Reserve

    admin.site.register(Animal, admin.GeoModelAdmin)
    admin.site.register(Reserve, admin.GeoModelAdmin)

Now go to the admin, add a reserve object and notice how GeoDjango allows you
to draw a polygon, representing the boundaries of the reserve. Also try to edit
an animal, and see how you can move the point on the map to change its
position.

Once you're finished with the admin site, head over to the :doc:`part 3 of this
tutorial </ref/contrib/gis/intro/tutorial03>`, which will show you various
tools you can use to display geographic data on your site.
